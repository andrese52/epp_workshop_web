## Software Installation

Required software depends on the Operational System that you have installed on your personal computer. Since we will be working in the OSU High Performance Computing Center (HPC), we need a terminal access.

### <i class='fa fa-windows'></i>  Windows 
Since windows does not have a bash terminal to create ssh connections. We are required to install Putty in all windows systems. 
To install Putty you need to [download](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) its latest version. Please follow all the installation guidelines on the installation prompt.

### <i class='fa fa-apple'></i> Mac
Mac has a default terminal client that includes Bash. Therefore, there is no need to install any extra software.

### <i class='fa fa-linux'></i> Linux
Linux has a default terminal client that includes bash. If you are using linux, you do not need anything installed for this class.

**Installation of the software and guidelines will be given during a pre-workshop meeting. Please raise your hand if you did not attend to the pre-workshop meeting.**
