## Introduction

Learning how to work your way around a command-line interface is the starting point of your bioinformatics journey. In this session, you'll learn basic and advanced Unix commands that programmers and bioinformaticians use very often. 

I want to share some resources that might be useful to your future pratice. [Click here](./links) if you are interested. 

I want to give you a little pep talk before you dive into the lectures:

+ You'll only learn by doing it! So practice, practice, and practice... I mean practice a lot!
+ There are many ways to do the same thing and achieve the same results.
+ Treat your code as experiments.
+ Errors are not bad! Often, errors point you to the right direction.
+ If you don't know, ask Google!

Warm up your finger tips, my friends! [Let's log in](../start/_index.md) and [get started](./unix_essentials)!!
