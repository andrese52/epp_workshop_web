## Basic Scripting and real life exercises

> #### "Every expert was once a beginner" *Helen Hayes*

The best way to learn bioinformatics is through examples of real world problems. This section assumes that you have some knowledge of biology and basic understanding of the Unix command line (now that you have taken the [morning section](../morning)).
In this section you will learn every day bioinformatic exercises. We will divide the afternoon section into three portions.
