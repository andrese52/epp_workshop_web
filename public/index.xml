      <description>We will be using examples associated with genomic analyses in bioinformatics, therefore, it is important for you to become familiar with the following terms.
What is a read? A read is a string of bases represented by their one letter codes. Here is an example of a read that is 100 bases long. TTAACCTTGGTTTTGAACTTGAACACTTAGGGGATTGAAGATTCAACAACCCTAAAGCTTGGGGTAAAACCTTAGGGGAT
What is a contig? A contig is the consensus sequence generated by aligning reads to themselves.</description>

      <description>Filesystem is a term that describes how data in arranged on a computer. It&amp;rsquo;s made out of directories and files. Directory = folder.
Prompt $ or % indicates command-line = computer is waiting for your command
Directories and files have an &amp;ldquo;address&amp;rdquo;, which is called path.
Types of paths:
 Absolute path starts with &amp;lsquo;/&amp;rsquo; that indicate it starts from the root directory (where it all begins) Relative path is relative to our current working directory (from this point forward)  In the Cowboy:</description>

      <description>Contents  Basic awk Basic sed sort, uniq, cut, etc. GFF3 Annotations Other generally useful aliases for your .bashrc  Basic awk [back to top]
Very helpful command to separate columns. Similar to excel.
Extract fields 2, 4, and 5 from file.txt:
awk &#39;{print $2,$4,$5}&#39; input.txt  Print each line where the 5th field is equal to ‘abc123’:
awk &#39;$5 == &amp;quot;abc123&amp;quot;&#39; file.txt  Print each line where the 5th field is not equal to ‘abc123’:</description>

      <description>While using coding and bioinformatics, we want to avoid using graphical user interphases (GUIs) as much as we can. Can somebody answer why?
 Visualizing large datasets (as the ones that we are going to download) could be practically impossible. Opening the whole document will likely crash your computer.
  However, there are exceptions, where we already know the data structure of a file and we can start running codes on it.</description>

      <description>The Cowboy is a command-line interface  Forget about your mouse from now on. In the shell, only your keyboard will take you where you wanna be&amp;hellip;
 This is your shell prompt, and it looks like this whenever it&amp;rsquo;s ready to accept your commands (input):
your_username_here $  When you have your prompt, you communicate with the computer by typing a command and hitting enter to run it.</description>

      <description>Building our first script The native language of Linux for its terminal is bash and we can write scripts and create a small program that does all the above for us with single line in bash. First, we need to create a file with nano which is a text editor that is also installed in Linux by default. There are other text editors like vim. Using nano we can create a .</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s jump right into it!
First of all, get your things organized!
$ mkdir workshop_mar17 $ cd workshop_mar17 $ mkdir morning_session $ cd morning_session  I believe you have worked with (or heard of) a fasta file. Fasta files might have .fasta or .fa extensions. These are basically text files that contain nucleotide or protein sequences. A fasta file can contain gene sequences, or even an entire genome.
Let&amp;rsquo;s download an Aspergillus genome that is available on the web.</description>
