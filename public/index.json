Please follow all the installation guidelines on the installation prompt.\n Mac Mac has a default terminal client that includes Bash. Therefore, there is no need to install any extra software.\n Linux Linux has a default terminal client that includes bash.

	"content": " We will be using examples associated with genomic analyses in bioinformatics, therefore, it is important for you to become familiar with the following terms.\nWhat is a read? A read is a string of bases represented by their one letter codes. Here is an example of a read that is 100 bases long. TTAACCTTGGTTTTGAACTTGAACACTTAGGGGATTGAAGATTCAACAACCCTAAAGCTTGGGGTAAAACCTTAGGGGAT\nWhat is a contig? A contig is the consensus sequence generated by aligning reads to themselves.\n  Alignment and Consensus   The last line is the consensus of the aligned reads which we call a contig.\nWhat is a scaffold? A scaffold is a set of contigs that have been ordered and oriented based on mate pair or long distance information. Usually there are large gaps found between contigs. New sequencing technologies are helping to close those gaps.\nWhat is a chromosome? Chromosomes are the largest DNA molecules in the cell. Scaffolds can be ordered and oriented using a genetic map or HiC data into linkage groups or chromosomes. The ultimate goal of a genome assembly project is to assemble reads into chromosomes.\nNext Generation Sequencing Next-generation sequencing generates masses of DNA sequence data that\u0026rsquo;s richer and more complete than is imaginable with Sanger sequencing. Illumina sequencing systems can deliver data output ranging from 300 kilobases up to multiple terabases in a single run, depending on instrument type and configuration.\nSequence Assembly Sequence assembly refers to aligning and merging fragments from a longer DNA sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence. The assembly can be found at different stages of completion. It could be conting, scaffold or even chromosome level.\nSequence Annotation DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do.   Genes and Genome   What is a genome? A genome is an organism\u0026rsquo;s complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Most of the genomes available online have been partially assembled. We will find out how to retrieve these genomes and analyze them.\n We will practice with other researcher\u0026rsquo;s data to become a pro. Then we can analyze our own data.\n "

This is a GUI which helps people search and process data. This is given the fact that the data has been previously curated by others.\nThey also have access to an FTP site, where we can download files in bulk.

Well, let me introduce you to the beautiful awk\nawk -F'\\t' '$12 == \u0026quot;Chromosome\u0026quot;' aspergillus_assemblies.txt | wc -l   3   Can somebody tell me what are we doing with the above code?\n We are piping the output of awk to a wc command that is the famous word count. You can count how many lines are found in a file with wc -l.\nRedirecting the output to a new file:\n$ awk -F'\\t' '$12 == \u0026quot;Chromosome\u0026quot;' aspergillus_assemblies.txt \u0026gt; chr_aspergillus_assemblies.txt  Let\u0026rsquo;s check those 3 entries by using head\nhead chr_aspergillus_assemblies.txt  I want to get the ftp address to download those files.\n$ awk -F'\\t' '{print $20}' chr_aspergillus_assemblies.txt \u0026gt; ftp-ids.txt  and finally check if you got the three ftp addresses.\n$ less ftp-ids.txt  We want to compare these three genomes and we want to get the genome files and the annotation files (gff or gtf)\nYou can open one of the files to explore the directory, for example, let\u0026rsquo;s explore ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/002/655/GCA_000002655.1_ASM265v1\nThere are multiple files inside this directory, we are interested in .fna files. Let\u0026rsquo;s target those files with a wildcard and a while loop.\nFirst let\u0026rsquo;s make a dir for the genomes\n$ mkdir genomes  while read p; do echo $p wget -P genomes/ $p/*.fna.gz done \u0026lt;ftp-ids.txt  File compression Most files in bioinformatics are shared compressed, otherwise they can weight many Gigabytes. The most common compression that you will find online is .gz. The best way to uncompress this type of files is by typing gunzip *.gz\nWe can try that with a loop\ncd genomes  for i in *.gz do echo \u0026quot;Unzipping $i\u0026quot; gunzip $i done  DONE, now you have fasta files to analyze. And this is the way you retrieve data in bulk from ftp sites.\n FIVE Minute task #1 Download those three genomes. I should retrieve the ftp address for each of them from chr_aspergillus_assemblies.txt. Use awk to write the output to a new .txt file.\n Use awk and select a different column number. Sol.\n "

To redirect stdin, you can use \u0026lt;\n$ cat \u0026lt; mgrisea_mat1_aa.txt \u0026gt;lcl|AB080670.2_prot_BAC65087.1_1_[gene=MAT1-1-1]_alpha_box MIASLSPDDIARLIPQETLTSLLRANDEKERLRELPVSPRAVAAASKNKKKVNGFMAFRSYYAGIFQDRPQKERSPFITLLWQKETLKSRWTLMANVFSRIRDFAGTTRGRMAMSGFLRVACPLLGITKPCDYLRRYNWELEFVADASAPYDAAMKYEISQSQIPHIVDEFEVPTTEIELLRACVQGGFPFENSAQLLRDMEDSSVTVMTRTAPIMAPSHASQASHGQHNHHFINTLINDPDAAISALLPQDEDIGSLMVDMNIIHSLETDSSTTSSARNSVSPLEQHLFFHEDVSIDPSTMVSFPGEGHGHPETQYSYPNPTLGLW  or, you can simply omit \u0026gt;\n$ cat mgrisea_mat1_aa.txt \u0026gt;lcl|AB080670.2_prot_BAC65087.1_1_[gene=MAT1-1-1]_alpha_box MIASLSPDDIARLIPQETLTSLLRANDEKERLRELPVSPRAVAAASKNKKKVNGFMAFRSYYAGIFQDRPQKERSPFITLLWQKETLKSRWTLMANVFSRIRDFAGTTRGRMAMSGFLRVACPLLGITKPCDYLRRYNWELEFVDASAPYDAAMKYEISQSQIPHIVDEFEVPTTEIELLRACVQGGFPFENSAQLLRDMEDSSVTVMTRTAPIMAPSHASQASHGQHNHHFINTLINDPDAAISALLPQDEDIGSLMVDMNIIHSLETDSSTTSSARNSVSPLEQHLFFHEDVSIDPSTMVSFPGEGHGHPETQYSYPNPTLGLW  Standard output The output of these commands is printed on the screen (stdout).\nThe stdout on the screen means that:\n1. Output is not being stored anywhere in any form\n2. The command is not altering the original data\nBasic commands  Who are you? whoami prints your username.\n  $ whoaim nathalia   Where am I? pwd stands for print current working directory. It prints your current location, aka path.  $ pwd /home/nathalia   What kind of path is this?\n  Directory listing. ls lists files and directories in your current directory  $ ls   This prints the listing to the screen. If empty, won\u0026rsquo;t print anything.\n ls is a command that has options, which modify the default behavior of a command. In the case of ls, options consist of a dash and one or more characters such as ls -l\n$ ls -l   Did you notice a different in listing display?\n You: Natty, I love options. I wanna see all options for ls! Natty: You can check out the manual page for all the options available!\nFor any command, man opens up the manual page of any command as a kind of pop-up window.\n$ man ls   LS(1) User Commands LS(1) NAME ls - list directory contents SYNOPSIS ls [OPTION]... [FILE]... DESCRIPTION List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default). Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort. Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too. -a, --all do not ignore entries starting with . -A, --almost-all do not list implied . and .. --author with -l, print the author of each file -b, --escape print octal escapes for nongraphic characters --block-size=SIZE use SIZE-byte blocks. See SIZE format below -B, --ignore-backups do not list implied entries ending with ~ -c with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last modification of file status information) with -l: show ctime and sort by name otherwise: sort by ctime (...)  Hit q to exit and return to the command-line.\n You: But, Nathy, what\u0026rsquo;s your favorite flag?\nNatty: I am so glad you asked!\n $ ls -lhtr   Test it out. Search the man pages, and figure out what each options does.\n  Creating a directory. mkdir stands for make a directory, and it requires input directory name. It should be a new name, never duplicate names.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a directory for our workshop.  $ mkdir workshop_mar17   Hit ls.\n We created the directory, however we are not inside yet.\n Change directory. cd is the command to change directories. This commands requires input directory name that should be immediately where you are (aka, your working directory).  $ cd workshop_mar17   Hit pwd.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s say we wanted to go back to our /home. There are multiple ways to do that:\nOption 1:\n$ cd ~  Option 2:\n$ cd  Option 3:\n$ cd /home/*your_username_here*  With cd we can move across different levels of directory hierarchy if you input a path.\nThe figure below is a representation of a file system. Let\u0026rsquo;s pause for 2 minutes to check this out.\n INSERT FILE SYSTEM FIGURE\n Your prompt is in /home. Now, try to answer these questions quickly without coding:\n- What\u0026rsquo;s the command to change directory to aa_sequences/?\n- What\u0026rsquo;s the command to change directory to cowboy_scripts/?\n- What\u0026rsquo;s the command to change directory to annotation/?\nNow, your prompt is in /annotation. Try to answer these questions quickly without coding:\n- What do you see inside this directory?\n- What\u0026rsquo;s the command to change directory to workshop_mar17/?\n.

Looks much better.\nTo exit nano and save the file, hit crtl+X. Notice that a new message appears on the bottom of the screen:\n Save modified buffer (ANSWERING \u0026quot;No\u0026quot; WILL DESTROY CHANGES) ? Y Yes N No ^C Cancel  Because we just created this file (made changes to it), nano is asking if we want to save what we just typed.

If all looks good, hit enter and you are back in the command-line.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a new directory:\n$ mkdir testings   To create a copy of the fasta file, use cp, which stands for copy.  If you want to create a duplicate of the file in the same directory you must provide a new name for the duplicate:\n$ cp example_sequence.fasta nucleotide_sequences.fasta  If you want to creat a copy of the file in testings/ you must provide the path to the directory (don\u0026rsquo;t provide a new name):\n$ cp example_sequence.fasta testings/ $ ls testings/ example_sequence.fasta  In our current directory, you should have:\n$ ls example_sequence.fasta nucleotide_sequences.fasta testings/   The command to rename a file and to move a file around is the same. mv stands for move, but you also use it to rename files.  To rename a file:\n$ mv example_sequence.fasta original_nucleotide_sequences.fasta $ ls nucleotide_sequences.fasta original_nucleotide_sequences.fasta testings/  Create a new directory named original:\n$ mkdir original  To move original_nucleotide_sequences.fasta into original/:\n$ mv original_nucleotide_sequences.fasta original/  To move a file:\n$ mv file_name_A directory_name_B/\nTo rename a file:\n$ mv file_name_A file_name_B\n  To delete a file, use rm that stands for remove.  A word of caution here: when you remove a file from the command-line, the file is removed forever and there is no way to recover it.\nWith rm THERE IS NO GOING BACK!\n $ rm nucleotide_sequences.fasta  $ ls original/ testings/   To delete a directory, use rm -r.  THERE IS NO GOING BACK!\n $ rm -r testings/ $ ls original/  If a directory is empty, you can use rmdir. If a directory isn\u0026rsquo;t empty, use rm -r.\nYup\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s gone!\nHow\u0026rsquo;s that for your first exposure to Cowboy? Any questions? "
