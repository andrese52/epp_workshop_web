	"content": " We will be using examples associated with genomic analyses in bioinformatics, therefore, it is important for you to become familiar with the following terms.\nWhat is a read? A read is a string of bases represented by their one letter codes. Here is an example of a read that is 100 bases long. TTAACCTTGGTTTTGAACTTGAACACTTAGGGGATTGAAGATTCAACAACCCTAAAGCTTGGGGTAAAACCTTAGGGGAT\nWhat is a contig? A contig is the consensus sequence generated by aligning reads to themselves.\n  Alignment and Consensus   The last line is the consensus of the aligned reads which we call a contig.\nWhat is a scaffold? A scaffold is a set of contigs that have been ordered and oriented based on mate pair or long distance information. Usually there are large gaps found between contigs. New sequencing technologies are helping to close those gaps.\nWhat is a chromosome? Chromosomes are the largest DNA molecules in the cell. Scaffolds can be ordered and oriented using a genetic map or HiC data into linkage groups or chromosomes. The ultimate goal of a genome assembly project is to assemble reads into chromosomes.\nNext Generation Sequencing Next-generation sequencing generates masses of DNA sequence data that\u0026rsquo;s richer and more complete than is imaginable with Sanger sequencing. Illumina sequencing systems can deliver data output ranging from 300 kilobases up to multiple terabases in a single run, depending on instrument type and configuration.\nSequence Assembly Sequence assembly refers to aligning and merging fragments from a longer DNA sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence. The assembly can be found at different stages of completion. It could be conting, scaffold or even chromosome level.\nSequence Annotation DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do.   Genes and Genome   What is a genome? A genome is an organism\u0026rsquo;s complete set of DNA, including all of its genes. Most of the genomes available online have been partially assembled. We will find out how to retrieve these genomes and analyze them.\n We will practice with other researcher\u0026rsquo;s data to become a pro. Then we can analyze our own data.\n "

Can somebody answer why?\n Visualizing large datasets (as the ones that we are going to download) could be practically impossible. Opening the whole document will likely crash your computer.\n  However, there are exceptions, where we already know the data structure of a file and we can start running codes on it.\nNCBI which stands for the The National Center for Biotechnology Information helps bioinformaticians by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. This is a GUI which helps people search and process data. This is given the fact that the data has been previously curated by others.\nThey also have access to an FTP site, where we can download files in bulk. Usually, exploring these folders become difficult, therefore, they create summary files that we can play with.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by downloading the assembly_summary_genbank.txt from the NCBI FTP site at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/ASSEMBLY_REPORTS/.

Filtering Data [back to top]\nLet\u0026rsquo;s focus on our organism of interest Aspergillus flavus. Let\u0026rsquo;s try searching for our pathogen in the database:\n$ grep \u0026quot;aspergillus flavus\u0026quot; assembly_summary_genbank.txt  What did you get as output from the previous code? NOTHING? HOW COME??\nTry this\n$ grep -i \u0026quot;aspergillus flavus\u0026quot; assembly_summary_genbank.txt  Take 1 minute to understand why this happened You are right, this is because you added the -i argument which asks for case insensitive\n Let\u0026rsquo;s count how many entries for Aspergillus flavus we have and at the same time let\u0026rsquo;s redirect our entries to a file named aspergillus_assemblies.txt  $ grep -ic \u0026quot;aspergillus flavus\u0026quot; assembly_summary_genbank.txt $ grep -i \u0026quot;aspergillus flavus\u0026quot; assembly_summary_genbank.txt \u0026gt; aspergillus_assemblies.txt  17  We do have 17 assemblies of Aspergillus flavus available in this FTP site. Guess what, not all of them are of importance to us. I want only assemblies at the chromosome level. Remember that there can be different types of assembly levels See above. We want to sort by column to select those Chromosomal assemblies (if any). Now that we have retrieved data we will learn how to filter by column in the next session.\nWell, let me introduce you to the beautiful awk (We will be seeing more of awk under Regular Expressions)\n$ awk -F'\\t' '$12 == \u0026quot;Chromosome\u0026quot;' aspergillus_assemblies.txt | wc -l   0  Can somebody tell me what are we doing with the above code?\nWe are piping the output of awk to a wc command that is the famous word count. You can count how many lines are found in a file with wc -l.\nUnfortunately, we have 0 crhomosomal assemblies. Now let\u0026rsquo;s try Scaffolds.\n TASK 1: [back to top]\nComplete the following tab-delimited table with information about how many assemblies are at the chromosome, scaffold and contig level. The table must look something like this:\n   Assembly level Number of assemblies     Chromosome 0   Scaffold \u0026ndash;   Contig \u0026ndash;    HINT: You can create a for loop\n  Solution 1 First we need to know which list will be used in our for loop. In this case I want a list of Chromosome, Scaffold and Contig. Then you create the loop like so:\nfor i in Chromosome Scaffold Contig do assemblies=`awk -v var=\u0026quot;$i\u0026quot; -F'\\t' '$12 == Chromosome' aspergillus_assemblies.txt | wc -l` echo -e $i'\\t'$assemblies \u0026gt;\u0026gt; table_assemblies.txt echo -e $i'\\t'$assemblies done  Did you really try to only copy and paste the loop and got an error? Try harder\u0026hellip;.. Focus on the var\nThe result should look something like this:\n[asecas86@n252 afternoon]$ for i in Chromosome Scaffold Contig \u0026gt; do \u0026gt; assemblies=`awk -v var=\u0026quot;$i\u0026quot; -F'\\t' '$12 == var' aspergillus_assemblies.txt | wc -l` \u0026gt; echo -e $i ' \\t ' $assemblies \u0026gt;\u0026gt; table_assemblies.txt \u0026gt; echo -e $i ' \\t ' $assemblies \u0026gt; done Chromosome 0 Scaffold 5 Contig 12  Let us retrieve only the best assemblies, in this case lets select Scaffolds\n$ awk -F'\\t' '$12 == \u0026quot;Scaffold\u0026quot;' aspergillus_assemblies.txt \u0026gt; chr_aspergillus_assemblies.txt  Let\u0026rsquo;s check those 5 entries by using head\n$ head chr_aspergillus_assemblies.txt  I want to get the ftp address to download those files.\n$ awk -F'\\t' '{print $20}' chr_aspergillus_assemblies.txt \u0026gt; ftp-ids.txt  and finally check if you got the five ftp addresses.\n$ less ftp-ids.txt  We want to compare these five genomes. Therefore, we want to get the genome files and the annotation files (fasta and gff or gtf)\nYou can open one of the files to explore the directory, for example, let\u0026rsquo;s explore this: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/002/443/195/GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard\n  There are multiple files inside this directory, we are interested in .fna and gff or gtf files. Let\u0026rsquo;s target those files with a wildcard and a while loop.\nFirst let\u0026rsquo;s make a dir for the genomes and annotations that we will retrieve:\n$ mkdir genomes  Now finally let us retrieve those files with the following loop:\nwhile read p; do echo $p wget -P genomes/$p/*.fna.gz done \u0026lt;ftp-ids.txt  Now check what files you downloaded:\n$ ls -lth genomes/  total 77M -r--r--r-- 1 asecas86 clusterusers 12M Jan 5 22:21 GCA_002864195.1_ASM286419v1_genomic.fna.gz -r--r--r-- 1 asecas86 clusterusers 11M Dec 14 01:09 GCA_002456175.1_AF36_genomic.fna.gz -r--r--r-- 1 asecas86 clusterusers 12M Nov 17 11:31 GCA_002443215.1_K49_genomic.fna.gz -r--r--r-- 1 asecas86 clusterusers 11M Nov 17 11:29 GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna.gz -r--r--r-- 1 asecas86 clusterusers 5.9M Nov 13 05:26 GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_cds_from_genomic.fna.gz -r--r--r-- 1 asecas86 clusterusers 5.9M Nov 13 05:26 GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_rna_from_genomic.fna.gz -r--r--r-- 1 asecas86 clusterusers 12M Jun 16 2016 GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.fna.gz  you should have 5 files, why do we have 7?\nThis is because these folders contain all information about annotations and sometimes they include CDS which stand for coding regions or rna which are regions that were mapped to the genome using its transcripts. It seems like the only one that has this issue is JCVI assembly.\nFile compression Most files in bioinformatics are compressed to allow fast sharing, otherwise they can weight many Gigabytes. The most common compression that you will find online is .gz. The best way to uncompress this type of files is by typing gunzip *.gz\nWe can try that with a loop\n$ cd genomes  for i in *.gz do echo \u0026quot;Unzipping $i\u0026quot; gunzip $i done  DONE, now you have fasta files to analyze.

	"content": " Contents  Intro Basic awk Identifying patterns in fasta files with awk Task 3 Task 4 Annotation files and awk Task 5 Extras with gff files  Intro [back to top]\nA regular expression, regex or regexp (sometimes called a rational expression) is, in theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually this pattern is then used by string searching algorithms for \u0026ldquo;find\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;find and replace\u0026rdquo; operations on strings.\nMultiple tools in LINUX can be utilized to find regular expressions. The most common one is grep which you already used during the morning.\nNow there are a couple of more powerful tools that work with regular expressions, these are awk and sed.\nFor example: the most basic awk command looks like this:\n$ awk '/pattern/{ print $0 }' file  Let\u0026rsquo;s move to one of our afternoon directories.\n$ cd /scratch/asecas86/afternoon  Basic awk [back to top]\nWe will be using basic awk with our fna and gff files. Lets start with fna files.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s move to genomes\n$ cd genomes  Now select the following file: GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna and run the following command:\n$ awk '/NNNNN/{ print $0 }' GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna  Pretty nasty output. We must linearize first the fasta files. There is this very helpful script that linearizes any fasta file. Let\u0026rsquo;s download it first.\n$ wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrese52/Training_datasets_scripting/master/scripts/linearize.sh  Let\u0026rsquo;s check how many lines GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna has prior linearizing it.\n$ wc -l GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna  453747 GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna  Run the script as follows:\n$ bash linearize.sh GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna  This script manipulates the fasta file and just reformats it to have the following format:\n\u0026gt;seq1 ATCCCCCCC \u0026gt;seq2 ATCTCTCT  Once the file is linearized, count the lines again like so:\n$ wc -l linearized_GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna  196 linearized_GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna  BOOM!! You have linearized a .fasta file. This is very helpful to manipulate the file and get metrics and regular expressions.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s make sure the file was correctly linearized by counting the number of fasta headers in the original file. The count should give 196\u0026frasl;2 = 98. Let\u0026rsquo;s check!!\n$ grep -c \u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot; GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna  98  GREAT, you just linearized a fasta file. Now let\u0026rsquo;s get some metrics.\nIdentifying patterns in fasta files with awk [back to top]\nAn important pattern to find are those nucleotides that have not been identified yet due to low quality sequencing. We might want to eliminate contigs or scaffolds containing these NNNN patterns since they are not useful for downstream analyses (this varies depending on the researcher\u0026rsquo;s needs). Let\u0026rsquo;s check:\n$ awk '/NNNNN/{ print $0 }' linearized_GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna | wc -l  32  So, 32 out of 98 contigs have some sort of NNNNN patterns of at least 5 Ns.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s get the sequence lengths of the current scaffolds\n$ cat linearized_GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna | awk 'NR%2==0' | awk '{print length($1)}'   What is happening above is that NR%2==0 is requesting that every even line in the file is printed, then these lines are piped into another awk that gives the length of the sequence.\n We can also redirect the output to a new file.\n  $ cat linearized_GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna | awk 'NR%2==0' | awk '{print length($1)}' \u0026gt; read_dist_GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna  Now let\u0026rsquo;s check the read distribution file\n$ head -n 5 read_dist_GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna  It appears like some scaffolds have 4 million nucleotides\n4471384 4150194 2714413 2659415 2557007   Task 3 [back to top] Linearize the fasta file GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.fna and count the number of nucleotides on each scaffold.\n $ bash linearize.sh GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.fna $ cat linearized_GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.fna | awk 'NR%2==0' | awk '{print length($1)}' \u0026gt; read_dist_GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.fna  Once you have both files let\u0026rsquo;s get the shortest contig lenghts:\n$ sort -n read_dist_GCA_002443195.1_AflaGuard_genomic.fna | head -n 1 $ sort -n read_dist_GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.fna | head -n 1   Task 4 [back to top] Obtain the largest contig length on both genomes\n Annotation files and awk [back to top]\nAnnotation files of these genomes contain information about the genes that the nucleotides encode. We will be doing some basic filtering with awk to find genes of interest.\nFirst let\u0026rsquo;s move to the annotations directory\n$ cd ../annotations  We will be working on the annotations of the same two genomes that we used for counting the length of each scaffold.\nImportant information about gff files can be found online here\nWhat is most important about these files is that they usually have 9 columns.\n   Position index Position name Description     1 sequence The name of the sequence where the feature is located.   2 source Keyword identifying the source of the feature, like a program (e.g. Augustus or RepeatMasker) or an organization (like TAIR).   3 feature The feature type name, like \u0026ldquo;gene\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;exon\u0026rdquo;. In a well structured GFF file, all the children features always follow their parents in a single block (so all exons of a transcript are put after their parent \u0026ldquo;transcript\u0026rdquo; feature line and before any other parent transcript line). In GFF3, all features and their relationships should be compatible with the standards released by the Sequence Ontology Project.   4 start Genomic start of the feature, with a 1-base offset. This is in contrast with other 0-offset half-open sequence formats, like BED files.   5 end Genomic end of the feature, with a 1-base offset. This is the same end coordinate as it is in 0-offset half-open sequence formats, like BED files.[citation needed]   6 score Numeric value that generally indicates the confidence of the source on the annotated feature. A value of \u0026ldquo;.\u0026rdquo; (a dot) is used to define a null value.   7 strand Single character that indicates the Sense (molecular biology) strand of the feature; it can assume the values of \u0026ldquo;+\u0026rdquo; (positive, or 5\u0026rsquo;-\u0026gt;3\u0026rsquo;), \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo;, (negative, or 3\u0026rsquo;-\u0026gt;5\u0026rsquo;), \u0026ldquo;.\u0026rdquo; (undetermined).   8 frame (GTF, GFF2) or phase (GFF3) Frame or phase of CDS features; it can be either one of 0, 1, 2 (for CDS features) or \u0026ldquo;.\u0026rdquo; (for everything else). Frame and Phase are not the same, See following subsection.   9 Attributes All the other information pertaining to this feature. The format, structure and content of this field is the one which varies the most between the three competing file formats    It would be good if we first explore the header:\n$ head -n 5 GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.gff  The header contains a lot of information about generalities of the annotation and the genome itself. We must skip these first lines. They are usually not tab-delimited.\nThe best way to do it is just by targetting lines of interest, for example I am interested in aflatoxin genes. Therefore I will grep the file for the pattern aflatoxin.\n$ grep -i \u0026quot;aflatoxin\u0026quot; GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.gff  Since I am interested only on those genes I will redirect the output.\n$ grep -i \u0026quot;aflatoxin\u0026quot; GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.gff \u0026gt; aflatoxin_genes.gff  Now let\u0026rsquo;s analyze by column. Usually the word aflatoxin should be found in the Attributes column which is column 9. So I can also get those same lines by doing this:\nPrint each line where the 9th field is similar to aflatoxin:\n$ awk -F \u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot; '$9 ~ \u0026quot;aflatoxin\u0026quot;' GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.gff  Now let\u0026rsquo;s check the difference between grep and awk\n$ grep -i \u0026quot;aflatoxin\u0026quot; GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.gff | wc -l $ awk -F \u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot; '$9 ~ \u0026quot;aflatoxin\u0026quot;' GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.gff | wc -l  We must get the same result for both which is 107 entries.\nWe have already redirected the aflatoxin annotations to a separate file. Now let\u0026rsquo;s play with that file.\nWe can get all the positive sense CDS and count them\n$ awk -F \u0026quot;\\t\u0026quot; '$7 == \u0026quot;+\u0026quot;' aflatoxin_genes.gff | wc -l  45   Task 5 [back to top] Count the number of CDS in the aflatoxin annotation file\n Extras with gff files [back to top]\nPrint all sequences annotated in a GFF3 file: This command will work only if we use the original gff file.\n$ cut -s -f 1,9 GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.gff | grep $'\\t' | cut -f 1 | sort | uniq  Determine all feature types annotated in a GFF3 file.\n$ grep -v '^#' GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.gff | cut -s -f 3 | sort | uniq  CDS exon gene mobile_genetic_element mRNA region  Here the -v in grep is saying to target the reverse of the search. If you remember whenever you did head in the annotation file there were many comments. It is trying to get rid of those lines first.\nThe output is piped to a cut where the -f is saying to select only the column 3 and the -s asks to avoid printing lines that do not contain the field 3 (empty lines or entries).\nDetermine the number of genes annotated in a GFF3 file.\n$ grep -c $'\\tgene\\t' GCA_000006275.2_JCVI-afl1-v2.0_genomic.gff  13485  "

	"content": " Contents  Introduction My First script Tips for nano Task 6 Using the TORQUE scheduler to submit jobs in Cowboy HPC  Intro [back to top]\nThe native language of Linux for its terminal is bash and we can write scripts and create a small program that does all the above for us with single line in bash. First, we need to create a file with nano which is a text editor that is also installed in Linux by default. There are other text editors like vim. Using nano we can create a .txt like so:\nMy First script [back to top]\nFirst let\u0026rsquo;s move to our afternoon folder and create a folder called scripts and cd to scripts\n$ cd /scratch/asecas86/afternoon $ mkdir scripts $ cd scripts  Then let\u0026rsquo;s type the following: You already learned how to use nano. Let\u0026rsquo;s practice.\n$ nano myfirstscript.txt  [asecas86@n252 scripts]$ nano myfirstscript.txt GNU nano 2.0.9 File: myfirstscript.txt Modified Andres Espindola [ New File ] ^G Get Help ^O WriteOut ^R Read File ^Y Prev Page ^K Cut Text ^C Cur Pos ^X Exit ^J Justify ^W Where Is ^V Next Page ^U UnCut Text ^T To Spell  Hit Ctrl+X then hit Y\nTips nano [back to top]\n Your mouse will NOT work at all in the terminal, so please do not try to click in different parts of the nano editor to edit the document.     Use your keyboard arrows to move around the document instead.    Now that you remembered how to use nano. We can create your first script.\nFirst let\u0026rsquo;s remove that file that you recently created.\n$ rm myfirstscript.txt  Any script in Linux should start with shebang:\u0026ldquo;#!\u0026rdquo;. Start another nano document:\n$ nano myfirstscript.sh  Type the following in the editor:\n#!/bin/bash # declare STRING variable STRING=\u0026quot;Pistol Pete\u0026quot; #print variable on a screen echo $STRING  Everything of what you are writing in your first bash script has been already covered during the morning session. Save the file and now we need to make it executable.\n$ chmod +x myfirstscript.sh  Now you can execute your first script\n$ ./myfirstscript.sh  Do you want to try something more difficult: YASSSS\nBuilding a script that contains arguments [back to top]\nMany scripts are created to facilitate the user typing the same code over and over again. Most of the scripts have inputs and outputs. In our previous script we did not have any of those.\nThe easiest way to create a bash script with input output feature is by adding argument options to the script.\nFor example, one of the scripts that we previously used to linearize fasta contained one argument.\n$ bash linearize.sh genome.fasta  The genome.fasta was the argument at that moment.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s modify the previous script in order to take arguments.\n$ nano myfirstscript.sh   GNU nano 2.0.9 File: myfirstscript.sh Modified #!/bin/bash # declare STRING variable STRING=$1 #print variable on a screen echo $STRING Save modified buffer (ANSWERING \u0026quot;No\u0026quot; WILL DESTROY CHANGES) ? Y Yes N No ^C Cancel  Hit Y to save and then let\u0026rsquo;s run the program with arguments\n TASK 6 [back to top] Create a Script that takes your first name and your last name as arguments and print them in the reverse order.\n Ideally, you can use all the information given in this small workshop to use different manipulation techniques and put them in a script that you can run on an everyday basis.\nUsing the TORQUE scheduler to submit jobs in cowboy HPC [back to top]\nAlthough we have been using the login nodes throughout this workshop. It is very very important to understand that computing intensive jobs must be submitted through the HPC scheduler. Now I will teach you how to do it.\nAll this information and guidelines are found at the HPC online tutorial. However, this is a very brief explanation how to use and submit a very basic job.\n First, to submit your job you need to have a submission script which contains all the arguments for submission. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a basic one:  nano my_first_pbs_script.pbs  Then we want to type the following inside that script. (Please copy and paste this part inside your nano prompt)\n#!/bin/bash #PBS -q express # specify the queue batch, express or bigmem #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=1 # request 1 processor on 1 node #PBS -l walltime=10:00 # choose a walltime slightly longer than your job will take #PBS -j oe cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR module load python/3.5.0 myfirstscript.sh  Once you have finished modifying you save it and submit the job as follows:\nqsub my_first_pbs_script.pbs  You can check your position in que queue by typing\nqstat -n | grep \u0026quot;yourusername\u0026quot;  Your STDOUT output will be written into a file that is created by the TORQUE scheduler.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s all FOLKS.\n"

Create a new repository\ngit init  First you have to configure your global git parameters\ngit config --global user.name \u0026quot;username\u0026quot;  You have initiated a new repository\na hidden folder called .git has been created\nls -ltha  total 256K drwxr-xr-x 7 asecas86 clusterusers 4.0K Mar 16 01:11 .git drwxr-xr-x 3 asecas86 clusterusers 4.0K Mar 16 01:11 . drwxr-xr-x 3 asecas86 clusterusers 4.0K Mar 16 01:11 .. -rwxr-xr-x 1 asecas86 clusterusers 101 Mar 16 01:10 myfirstscript.sh  git add *  Adds all the changes in your directory to the local git cache\ngit status  Shows all the changes you have done in your directory\n[asecas86@n252 my_git_script]$ git status # On branch master # # Initial commit # # Changes to be committed: # (use \u0026quot;git rm --cached \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;...\u0026quot; to unstage) # # new file: myfirstscript.sh  git commit -m \u0026quot;My first commit\u0026quot;  "
